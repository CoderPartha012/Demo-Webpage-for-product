Demo Webpage for product

This is an HTML and CSS code for a webpage that displays four products (Coca-Cola, Sprite, Dominos, and KFC). The page has a background of bubbles, created using CSS. Each product is displayed in a card format, which includes a logo, product image, a brief description, and two buttons (Order Now and Add to Cart). The HTML code begins with the html tag and includes a head and body section. The <head> section includes the title of the page, meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings, and a link to an external style sheet (style.css). The body section includes a container div and a bubbles div, which creates the bubble background effect. The products are displayed using four card div elements. Each card includes a circle div for the logo, a content div for the product description and buttons, and an image img element for the product image. The code uses CSS variables to set the color of the circle and the value of the data attribute "i" to create the bubble effect. The CSS for this effect is included in the external style sheet (style.css).
